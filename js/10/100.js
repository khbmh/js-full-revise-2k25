/*

Class and Object in OOP -
In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a template for creating objects. Classes define the shared characteristics of objects, such as their variables and methods.

** How classes work
State: Variables that are associated with a class 
Behavior: Methods that are associated with a class 
Inheritance: A class can be based on another class, inheriting its state and behavior 
Subclasses: Classes can have subclasses that inherit some or all of the class's characteristics 
Superclass: The class that a subclass is based on is its superclass 


** Benefits of classes
Modularity: Classes encourage modularity, which makes it easier to maintain complex systems 
Reusability: Classes make code reusable by binding data and methods together 
Organization: Classes encourage code organization, which makes it easier to maintain complex systems 
Examples of classes
A car class can define a model, color, passenger capacity, speed, and methods like accelerate 
A mobile phone class can define attributes like brand name and RAM, and functions like texting and calling
