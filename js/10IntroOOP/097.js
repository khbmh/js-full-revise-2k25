/*

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, a programming model that organizes software around objects instead of logic. OOP is used to create software that is complex, large, and often updated. 
OOP concepts 

Classes: User-defined data types that act as blueprints for objects
Objects: Instances of a class that are created with specific data
Methods: Functions that objects can perform
Attributes: Represent the state of an object
